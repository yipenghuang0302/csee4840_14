\section{Architecture}

For our project we will be using the FPGA as an accelerator for
inverse kinematics computations. Software running on the ARM processor 
on the SoCKit board will be driving the FPGA and will display its outputs on 
a monitor. The user should be allowed to specify a robot design via an XML file, which contains the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for the robot. The software will supply target Cartesian coordinates 
to the accelerator, which will return updated joint configurations to 
move towards the given target coordinates. The software will use the 
joint configuration to update an image on the monitor. The resulting 
image should result in an animation of a appendage moving towards a target 
position.
