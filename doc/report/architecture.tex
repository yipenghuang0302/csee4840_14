\section{Architecture}
For our project we use the FPGA as an accelerator for
inverse kinematics computations. Software running on the ARM processor 
on the SoCKit board drives the FPGA and displays the incremental joint 
positions on a robot arm displayed with an openGL program.
The user is allowed to specify a robot design via an XML file, 
which contains the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for the robot. 
The software supplies target Cartesian coordinates 
to the accelerator, which returns updated joint configurations that
move the robot arm's end effector towards the given target coordinates. 
The software uses the 
joint configuration to update an image on the monitor. The resulting 
image results in an animation of an appendage moving towards a target 
position.
