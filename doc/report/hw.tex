\section{Hardware}

We will represent numbers as 27-bit fixed point numbers in our hardware.

We are limited in the number of digital signal processors and lookup tables available in the FPGA. We pay attention to reusing units that use a lot of area, and time multiplex their use so they are used multiple times in the algorithm.

In the following subsections, we describe the submodules of the accelerator. Then, we describe the custom functional units we have to build in order to assemble our submodules. We assemble these custom functional units using IP designs generated by Altera MegaFunctions.
