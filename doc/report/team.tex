A section listing who did what

Lianne created the skeleton of the C implemenation of our algorithm used 
for understanding the algorithm and how components would fit together. She 
produced the template openGL file which was used to demonstrate that the 
IK Swift accelorator was working. Lianne also looked into matrix inverse 
algorithms and determined the best method for inverting matrices in our 
program. She implemented the two step process of inverting matrices in 
system verilog so that it could be interfaced with the rest of the 
hardware files. After our hardware was built she worked with qsys to 
develop the files required to interface the IK Swift accelorator with 
the device driver runing on the ARM processor.
