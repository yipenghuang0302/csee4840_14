A section listing who did what

Lianne created the skeleton of the C implemenation of our algorithm used 
for understanding the algorithm and how components would fit together. She 
produced the template openGL file which was used to demonstrate that the 
IK Swift accelorator was working. Lianne also looked into matrix inverse 
algorithms and determined the best method for inverting matrices in our 
program. She implemented the two step process of inverting matrices in 
system verilog so that it could be interfaced with the rest of the 
hardware files. After our hardware was built she worked with qsys to 
develop the files required to interface the IK Swift accelorator with 
the device driver runing on the ARM processor. 

Richard designed the skeleton for the system verilog module that calculates the Jacobian
for a given configuration. Other than that, all of Richard's tangible contributions are on the
softare end of the project. He designed the device driver to communicate with the hardware and
modified Lianne's openGL template to display an actual robot arm and interact with the device
driver. In terms of deliverables, Richard was in charge of maintaining accurate milestones over the
course of the semester and developed the pseudocode to describe the Jacobian and
Damped Least-Squares algorithms.
