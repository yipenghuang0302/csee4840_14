\subsubsection{Full Matrix Multiplication Pipeline}

A series of joints connected together by links in an appendage form a kinematic chain. To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we must first have the forward kinematic description of the robot. We can describe the location and orientation of the end of the appendage with yet another 4 by matrix. This full forward kinematics matrix is simply the product of the matrices that describe each joint. We can calculate this in hardware using the pipeline shown in Figure \ref{fig:dh_transform_pipeline}.
