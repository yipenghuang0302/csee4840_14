This is a critical part of the project and will be a substantial fraction of the grade.
Include the following sections:
An overview of your project: a revised version of your project proposal.
The detailed project design documents: a revised version of the project design.
A section listing who did what and what lessons you learned and advice for future projects
Complete listings of every file you wrote for the project. Include C source, SystemVerilog source, and things such as .mhs files. Don't include any file that was generated automatically.
Include all of this in a single .pdf file (don't print it out) and email it to me on the due date.
Also create a .tar.gz file (see the online documentation for the `tar' program to see how to create such a file. Briefly, create a file called `myfile' with the names of all the files you want to include in the archive and run tar zcf project.tar.gz `cat myfiles` to create the archive.) that just includes the files necessary to build your project, such as I did for the labs. Also email this to me by the due date.
