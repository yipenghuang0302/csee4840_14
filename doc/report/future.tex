\subsection{Lessons Learned and Future Work}
What lessons you learned and advice for future projects

The most important lesson I learned for programming embedded systems or any hardware design 
is that planning first is absolutely necessary for not just a good design but one that works. 
By writing out detailed timing diagrams and just matching up what step of an algorithm has to 
happen when is crucial to identifying what resources can be shared and what can happen in 
parallel.
