Binaries produced by IKFast claim to finish in as fast as 4 microseconds on a fast OoO processor. Given the 50 MHz base clock on the FPGA, our algorithm would have to finish in 200 cycles to match software implementations.

Planners require being able to process thousands of configurations per second. The closed-form code generated by ikfast can produce solutions on the order of ~4 microseconds! As a comparison, most numerical solutions are on the order of 10 milliseconds (assuming good convergence).
