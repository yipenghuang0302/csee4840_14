\section{Hardware/Software Interface}

We will design a ``joint" peripheral through which the software and hardware components of our system will interact. 
The driver for the joint peripheral will provide an ioctl that copies a struct to and from the user with the following components:
\begin{verbatim}
unsigned char target[3]; /* The x,y,z, coordinates of the 
														target position for our end-effector */
unsigned char joint_type; /* the ith bit is 1 if the ith joint is 
														 rotational, 0 for translational */
unsigned char joint; /* 0,1,...,JOINT_DOF-1 */
unsigned char parameter;  /* THETA,L_OFFSET,L_DISTANCE,ALPHA */ 
unsigned short magnitude; 
\end{verbatim}
The \texttt{joint} field represents which joint we're referring to (we have a total of \texttt{JOINT\_DOF} joints), the \texttt{joint\_type}
field keeps track of the type of every joint in system, the \texttt{parameter} field
is a constant signifying which D-H parameter we're reading or writing, and the magnitude field holds the value of that D-H parameter.

The registers used by the device driver are represented with the following struct, following the example given in lab 3:

\begin{verbatim}
struct joint_dev{
	struct resource res;		/* Resource: our registers */
	void __iomem *virtbase; /* Pointer to registers */
	u8 joint_type; /* ith bit is 1 if ith joint is rotational, 0 for translational */
	u16 target[3]; /* Target position */
	u16 dh_params[JOINT_DOF * 4] /* Every joint has 4 parameters */
} dev;
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{joint\_type} and \texttt{target} fields mirror the same fields in the user-level struct and are only set once during the configuration
stage of our pipeline. The \texttt{dh\_params} array in the given struct will be used to read and write magnitudes for various D-H parameters in the 
given configuration. For example, the magnitude of the third joint's theta parameter would be stored at \texttt{dh\_params[2*4 + THETA]}. Note that
since the only parameters that our algorithm modifies are $\theta_i$ and $d_i$ for joint $i$, these are the only components of our struct that
will be modified after the start of our algorithm.
