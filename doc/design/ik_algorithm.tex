\section{Inverse Kinematics Algorithm}
We first present an algorithm that takes as input $n$ homogenous transformation matrices $T^{i-1}_i$ for $i=1$ to $n$, and
the current position of our end effector in three-dimensional space, which is represented as the vector $s$. 
The output of the algorithm is the Jacobian matrix for the current system configuration. Given matrices $A$ and $B$, we use the notation
$AB$ for matrix multiplaction and $A \times B$ for the cross-product in the following pseudocode.\\

The following algorithm describes the Jacobian Damped Least-Squares method of solving the inverse kinematics problem. 
As input we are given a set of D-H parameters that fully define
the initial positions of the joints of our robot appendage, as well as a three-dimensional target position for our end effector. 
Formally, for each joint $i = 1 \ldots n$ we have D-H parameters $\theta_i, d_i, a_i, \alpha_i$, and
we call our target vector $t$. The final output of our algorithm is a set of updated D-H parameters that fully define
the required position of our joints such that the end effector position is sufficiently close to the target.
Although the algorithm given applies to a general $n-$jointed robot, we will only consider robots with 6 joints in our system, leading
to a 6x6 Jacobian matrix.

Let $\epsilon$ be the desired accuracy of our final results\;
\For{$i = 1$ to $n$}{
	Calculate the homogenous transformation matrix $T^{i-1}_i$ for joint $i$ using the given D-H parameters\;
}
Let $T^0_n = \prod_{i=1}^n T^{i-1}_i$ be the full homogenous transformation matrix for the system\;
Let $s$ be a column vector composed of the top three scalars in the last column of $T^0_n$. This is the current position of our end effector\;
Let $e = t - s$ be the desired change in the position of our end effector\;
Set $e = \begin{bmatrix*} e & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix*}^T$ so we can use it in our Jacobian equations, which deal with 6 x 6 matrices\;
Let $J = JACOBIAN(T^0_1, T^1_2, \ldots, T^{n-1}_n, s)$ be the Jacobian matrix for the current system configuration\;
\While{the $l^2$ norm of $e$ is greater than $\epsilon$}{
	Let $J^T$ be the transpose of $J$\;
	Let $\lambda$ be a small positive constant\; 
	Let $I$ be the identity matrix\;
	Use row operations to determine the vector $f$ that satisfies the equation $(JJ^T+\lambda^2I)f = e$\;
	Let $\Delta \theta = J^T f$ be a vector whose $i$th component is a change in joint $i$'s angle. Note that
		if joint $i$ is translational along the unit vector $v_i$, then the joint ``angle" measures the distance
			moved in the direction $v_i$ and the $i$th component in $\Delta \theta$ will be a change in $d_i$\; 
	\For{$i = 1$ to $n$}{
		\eIf{joint $i$ is translational}{
			Set $d_i$ = $d_i + \Delta \theta [i]$\;
		}
		{
			Set $\theta_i = \theta_i + \Delta \theta[i]$\;
		}
		Recalculate $T^{i-1}_i$\;
	}
	Recalculate $T^0_n, s, e,$ and $J$ using our updated homogenous transformation matrices\;

Return the final set of D-H parameters currently specifying the positions of our joints\;
