\section{Hardware}

The FPGA design will consist mostly of floating point arithmetic. Working 
with floating point numbers will be our biggest challenge. Altera has 
Megafunctions built in to Quartus II which create IP blocks for solving trigonometric and matrix functions.

fp <-> integer

In the following subsections, we describe the submodules of the accelerator.
%sine and cosine on FPGA
%Trigonometric Functions
%ALTFP_ATAN: Arctangent 34 cycle delay
%ALTFP_SINCOS: Trigonometric Sine/Cosine 36, 35 cycle delay
