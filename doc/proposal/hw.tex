\section{Hardware}

The FPGA design will consist mostly of floating point arithmetic. Working 
with floating point numbers will be our biggest challenge. Altera has 
mega functions built in to Quartus II which will have the tools build 
already working and tested modules for trigonometric functions. Without 
these functions we most likely would not have been able to do this project. 
The mega functions we are planning on using 
are ALTFP\_ATAN and ALTFPSINCOS. As to be expected these functions take 
time to compute results. For example the ALTFP\_ATAN takes 34 cycles to 
compute the tangent function. While working on the design we might find 
that other floating point arithmetic mega functions will need to be used 
like addition and subtration.
