The FPGA design will consist mostly of floating point arithmetic. Working 
with floating point numbers will be our biggest challenge. Alter has 
mega functions for modules for floating point arithmetic including 
trigonometric functions. The mega functions we are planning on using 
are ALTFP_ATAN and ALTFP_SINCOS. As to be expected these functions take 
time to compute results. For example the ALTFP_ATAN takes 34 cycles to 
compute the tangent function.
