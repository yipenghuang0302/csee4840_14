You'll perform a design-it-yourself project in the second half of the class. There are five deliverables for the project:
A short project proposal describing in broad terms what you plan to build and how you plan to build it
A detailed project design describing in detail the architecture of your project, both hardware and software. This should include block diagrams, memory maps, lists of registers: everything someone else would need to understand your design. You should have done some preliminary implementation work by this point to validate your design.
Your design document should also a plan of what you intend to complete by each of the three milestones.
Three milestones that you set for yourself: think of 25%, 50%, and 75% completion
A presentation on your project to the class
A final project report
Project groups should be three students or more.
