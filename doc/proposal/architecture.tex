\section{Architecture}
For our project we will be using the FPGA as an accelerator for
inverse kinetic computations. Software running on the Linux ARM processor 
on the SoCKit board will be driving the FPGA and will display its outputs on 
a monitor. The FPGA will be configured for specific robot with given joint 
parameters. The software will supply current and target Cartesian coordinates 
to the IK accelerator which will return updated joint configurations to 
move towards the given target coordinates. The software will use the 
joint configuration to update an image on the monitor. The resulting 
image should result in an animation of a appendage moving towards a target 
position.
