Our project will be a combination of software and hardware. The software will 
be running on Linux on the ARM chip on the SoCKit board. It will supply current and target cartesian coordinates to the FPGA and display on the screen the 
updated coordinates found by the FPGA. The FPGA will act as an accelorator 
for the inverse kinetics computation to get the next positions.
